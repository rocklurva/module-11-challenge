Based on the information scrapped from the Mars weather site, we can come to the following assumptions:
- We can see that there are 12 months in Mars (the same that we have on Earth).
- The coldest month on Mars is on the third (3) month, while the hottest month is on the eighth (8) month.
- The month with the lowest pressure on Mars is on the sixth (6) month, while the highest pressure is on the ninth (9) month.
- Assuming that the sun circling Mars contributes to the temperature dropping/rising, we can say that the terrestrial days in a year for Mars can be estimated by getting the difference between 2 peak temperatures, i.e. around day 1400 and day 750. The difference leads to 650 days, so we can say that a year in Mars is equivalent to around 650 days in Earth.
